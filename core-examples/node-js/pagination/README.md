# Samples of requests with pagination to the Basic Blockchain API

## Problem

There is a limit on the number of records that the Blockchain API can return.
Now it is 50.

## Solution

If you expect your query to get more records, you can use pagination.

See examples of how this can be done.
You can read more about this pattern here:
[graphql.org/learn/pagination](https://graphql.org/learn/pagination/#pagination-and-edges)

## Run examples

```
npm i
node index.js
```
